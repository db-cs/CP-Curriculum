The Personalized Learning Plan (PLP) is the primary documentation that will drive your learning in this course. Initially, you will complete the PLP Part A which sets your goals and plans for learning. Then throughout the course, you will update the PLP Part B with experiences and evidence that you have met the course objectives. These documents are the backbone of this course and should be looked at and updated weekly.
