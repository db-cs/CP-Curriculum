Part A of the PLP gets you thinking about what your goals are for the class and how that connects to your career long-term plans. You have already started thinking about this informally in 050.C What I Want, but in Part A of the PLP you will need to restate these goals formally. I will work with you to craft these goals.

The PLP Part A is a living document that we will refine over the first couple of weeks. I will provide you with feedback. Once you have made revisions then you can just resubmit. The goal is to use this document as a conversation to ensure you get the best experience to help you prepare for your future career.
