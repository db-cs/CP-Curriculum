The PLP Part B is something you will need to continually update throughout the course. The Coding Practicum standards require that you document your progress in several key skills. Each skill is listed in Part B, and you will need to explain your experience and provide evidence of that experience. It is important to be constantly documenting everything you do in this course, so you can use that in the evidence section of Part B.

Periodically, I will do quick checks to see your progress. These will occur every nine weeks and at progress report times. It is important that you continuously update this document. **Do not wait until the last second.** As we go throughout the year, the PLP Part B will be a way for us to make sure you are getting the experiences you need to successfully complete the course. A final and refined version will not be due until the end of the course.
