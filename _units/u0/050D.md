## Overview

The activity log will be a critical piece of documentaiton you will complete each day. The goal is to record your activity in class. Often you will forget what you did last week, and you certainly won't remember what you did on a specific day after two months.

It is a normal practice for developers to go through performance reviews, and part of that is recounting your activity. The log will be an essential tool when you complete your first performance review.

## Submit

Open the dropbox above and complete your first entry. Do not turn in the assignment. You will revisit this log each day.
