## Overview

You will develop a portfolio throughout the course on GitHub. Your portfolio will be your GitHub profile. On your profile you can include a README that tells more about yourself. The rest of your portfolio will be pinned repositories. We'll let the code do the talking.

### Getting Started

It's easy to get started. Just create a new respository that is named the same thing as your user name. For example, if your username is `dnbailey` you would create a repository named `dnbailey`.

### Balancing Professional and Personal

As you build out your profile, consider the purpose of this portfolio. You want it to appear professional but still capture your personality. This is a tough balance to strike, but it is important. You don't want to appear to be so professional that you lack personality. People want to hire individuals that are technically proficient, but also are fun to work with.

## Pinned Repositories

Below your profile README, you can pin up to six repositories. These should showcase the best examples of your work throughout the semester or from previous semesters. You get a max of six, but you shouldn't just fill it up if something is not quality.

## Contributions

This semester you will work on diversifying the types of contributions you make on GitHub. Additionally, you will need to increase the frequency of your contributions. The goal is to show that you are active and engaged in the development community.

## Submit

In the dropbox above, submit a link to your GitHub profile (i.e. `github.com/<username>`). I will review your profile and provide feedback for improvement.
