## What will I learn in this unit?

We're really just getting set up this week and starting to understand what will be required of you for the course. It's critical that you understand the end goal, so look over the material in this unit carefully, ask questions, and make a plan.

## Portfolio Requirements

Create a portfolio, or similar collection of work, that illustrates mastery of skills and knowledge outlined in the previous courses and applied in the practicum. The portfolio should reflect thoughtful assessment and evaluation of the progression of work involving the application of steps of the design process, as outlined by the instructor. The following documents will reside in the studentâ€™s portfolio:

- Personal code of ethics
- Career and professional development plan
- Resume
- Project proposal with supporting documents
- List of responsibilities undertaken through the course
- Examples of visual materials developed and used during the course (such as drawings,
  models, presentation slides, videos, and demonstrations)
- Marketing plan
- Description of technology used, with examples if appropriate
- Periodic journal entries reflecting on tasks and activities
- Feedback from instructor and/or supervisor based on observations
