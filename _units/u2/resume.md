## Overview

Analyze the requirements and qualifications for various programming and development job postings identified from specific company websites or online metasearch engines. Gather information from multiple sources, such as sample resumes, interviews with professionals, and job boards, to determine effective strategies for realizing career goals. **Create a personal resume modeled after elements based on the findings above**.

This resume should be based on where you see yourself when applying for this future job. Include real life goals you have for after high school. The job you apply for should be a junior level or entry level position.

When you submit, please include the link to the job posting in the comments.

## Process

You should begin by exploring job boards and industry websites. Then start planning your resume. What do you need to include in a resume? What should you leave out? Use resources like websites and videos for tips and tricks on what to include. When you have a solid plan, choose a tool to create your resume. You want something easy to update and access. I use Google Slides personally. When have finished your design, proofread everything. Then submit a PDF copy at the dropbox above.
