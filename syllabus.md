# ðŸ’» Coding Praticum

Coding Practicum is a capstone course intended to provide you with the opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge learned in previous Coding courses toward the completion of an in-depth project with fellow team members. You will take on more responsibilities for producing independent work and managing processes involved in the planning, designing, refinement, and production of original software applications. A major portion of the course will be to independently produce software based on an area of interest, be it the development of a mobile application (app), a web application, or any other approved program that requires coding and development skills.

If you are serious about a career in Information Technology, then this course will help you prepare for your next steps. You will get a chance to hone your craft and produce work for your portfolio.

## What Will I Learn?

Upon completion of the practicum, you will be prepared for postsecondary study and career advancement in programming and software development and will be equipped to market your skills to potential colleges and/or employers. Think of this course as the launchpad for your next steps after graduation.

## How Do I Succeed In This Course?

To be successful in this course, you need to be ready to independently manage your work and learning. I will help you navigate, but you're the one behind the wheel and deciding where this journey leads. That means you will need to be organized and goal-oriented to truly get everything you can from this experience.

Additionally, you will be asked to complete tasks that maybe aren't glamorous but are important learning experiences. Success will be predicated on your ability to reflect and learn from those experiences. Pay attention to how you feel and react to these situations, and also think about your future.

The number one way to succeed in this class is to be engaged. Soak up everything you can from every assignment and experience.

## What Are The Class Policies?

Documentation is critical, so don't procrastinate. If it's not documented, it didn't happen.

### Virtual:

- Weekly check-ins via Google Meet are required. Check the calendar.
- Activity log is a critical document for me to know what you are working on throughout the week.

### Face-to-Face / Hybrid:

- You will get many freedoms to work independently and even outside the classroom at times. It is critical that you do not abuse this privilege.
- Sorry, no food or drinks in the classroom unless it's for a medical reason. If you need to eat please eat near the trash cans towards the beginning of class. We use expensive devices, so this policy is to prevent accidents. Water bottles are permitted as long as they are kept on the floor.
- Your MacBook login password should be secure as you have additional permissions on your computer. Do not share it with anyone.

### What Are The Expectations?

- We deliver our best work, not just our first work.
- We give grace to others and ourselves.
- We consider the impacts of our decisions and deal with the consequences of our actions.
- We value the contributions of our team and celebrate our successes.
